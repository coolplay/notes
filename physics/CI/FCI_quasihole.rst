    * AB phase
    * spatial extent function for qusihole in FQH

Abstract
--------

* Abelian qusiholes in `1/2` bosonic FQHE (torus) and FCI (PBC).
* Qusihole size, charge and statistics
* *Spatial extent* of a quasihole in FCI is obtained by substituting the magnetic
  length `l_B` in the continuum with an effective lattice-dependent magnetic
  length `l_B^{lat} = \sqrt{A/(2\pi)}`, with `A` the area of lattice unit cell.
